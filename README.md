# "Horror"-Game

/*
- Health bar on the top left of the screen
- Log book on bottom left of the screen (details events happened, current objectives)
  - Log book is Dr Frankenstein's research/journal
    - Undecipherable symbols at first
    - Symbols will become readable as (if) player "learns" how to read (might not happen due to the activities)
  
- Gameplay:
  - WASD to move
  - F for flashlight
  - Shift to run
  - M for map
  - L for log book
    - Log book will contain notes and current objectives
  
- Theme:
  - Frankenstein-esque main concept
  - Player plays a monster (though this is not shown or told)
    - They will encounter NPCs and depending on what they choose to do, there are different resultant sequences
    - The combined effects of the choices will affect the end result of the game
  - NPCs will appear as normal humans until a wrong choice is made to reveal their inner monster
    - Sometimes there will be no choice at all and the NPC will "turn" into a monster all on their own
    - Other times, depending on player's ability to hide/interact, there will be different results
      - i.e. if chosen to interact, maybe will gain food/shelter, but there will be added risks etc.
      - 
  
- Environment:
  - Semi open-world
    - Players guided by a map to know where to go
    - "Semi" as there are places players need to go to for the narrative/story to make sense (though there is no specific order they must do them)
    - Map locations will glow once they have been completed
    - 

- Scenes:
  1. Player wakes up on a slab
   - Slam of door, thunder and lightning with a flickering light above
   - First objective is to find a way out
   - Allow for player to take coat, hat and umbrella by the door
  2. Escape out of the city undetected
  3. Find food and shelter
